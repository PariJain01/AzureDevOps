## Task 4: Apply Branch Filters and Path Filters

### ðŸ”¹ Objective
Configure policies to trigger only when changes happen:
- On specific branches (branch filters)
- In specific folders or files (path filters)

---

### âœ… 1. Branch Filters
Branch policies were configured to apply to:
- `master`
- `develop`
- `main`
- `Tester`

This ensures critical branches are protected consistently.

---

### âœ… 2. Path Filters
Path filters were applied to enforce policies only on selected directories:

**Included Paths:**
- `/src/*`
- `/docs/*`

Changes outside these paths do not trigger the policy.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Summary
Branch and path filters were configured to:
- Enforce stricter controls on critical branches.
- Limit required approvals to relevant code areas.
